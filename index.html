        <h3>What is Child Labour?</h3>
        <p>
          The term “child labour” is often defined as work that deprives
          children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and
          that is harmful to physical and mental development. It refers to work
          that: is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and
          harmful to children

            Child labour refers to the exploitation of children through any form
            of work that deprives children of their childhood, interferes with
            their ability to attend regular school, and is mentally, physically,
            socially or morally harmful. Such exploitation is prohibited by
            legislation worldwide, although these laws do not consider all work
            by children as child labour; exceptions include work by child
            artists, family duties, supervised training, and some forms of child
            work practiced by Amish children, as well as by indigenous children
            in the Americas.

            Child labour has existed to varying extents throughout history.
            During the 19th and early 20th centuries, many children aged 5–14
            from poorer families worked in Western nations and their colonies
            alike. These children mainly worked in agriculture, home-based
            assembly operations, factories, mining, and services such as news
            boys—some worked night shifts lasting 12 hours. With the rise of
            household income, availability of schools and passage of child
            labour laws, the incidence rates of child labour fell.

            In the world's poorest countries, around one in four children are
            engaged in child labour, the highest number of whom (29 percent)
            live in sub-saharan Africa.[12] In 2017, four African nations (Mali,
            Benin, Chad and Guinea-Bissau) witnessed over 50 percent of children
            aged 5–14 working.[12] Worldwide agriculture is the largest employer
            of child labour.[13] The vast majority of child labour is found in
            rural settings and informal urban economies; children are
            predominantly employed by their parents, rather than factories.[14]
            Poverty and lack of schools are considered the primary cause of
            child labour.[15] Globally the incidence of child labour decreased
            from 25% to 10% between 1960 and 2003, according to the World
            Bank.[16] Nevertheless, the total number of child labourers remains
            high, with UNICEF and ILO acknowledging an estimated 168 million
            children aged 5–17 worldwide were involved in child labour in 2013
